        <h2>Our Origin Story</h2>
        <p>
          It started with a group of friends, some midnight munchies, and a
          dream: what if comfort food could be cool, inclusive, and
          unforgettable? From fried Oreos to trippy lighting and a vibe that
          makes everyone feel at home — Tasty Munchies was born to satisfy the
          weirdest, wildest, most wonderful cravings.
